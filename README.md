> My groundbreaking Nuxt.js project

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).


Things to do:
--figure out when update pushes to heroku (production mode)
--error handling (network error when searching for prince on heroku)
-make info page, that says it's from itunes
-make sure axios request is happening on the server side
--play around with async data in script vs the store reach out
-maybe a model that tells you what happens when an album is clicked
-maybe a database that stores star ratings
